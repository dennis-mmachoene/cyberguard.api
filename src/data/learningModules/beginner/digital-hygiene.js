        title: 'Software Updates and Patches',
        content: 'Software updates are critical for security. They fix vulnerabilities that hackers could exploit to gain access to your system. When you ignore update notifications, you leave known security holes open. Updates also improve performance and add new features, but their primary importance is security. Set your devices to update automatically whenever possible, and never postpone security updates.',

        title: 'Data Backup Strategies',
        content: 'Backing up your data is essential to protect against ransomware, hardware failure, and accidental deletion. Follow the 3-2-1 backup rule: keep 3 copies of your data, on 2 different types of storage media, with 1 copy stored offsite or in the cloud. Automate backups to ensure they happen regularly without you having to remember. Test your backups periodically to make sure you can actually restore your data when needed.',

          'Regularly test backup restoration',
        ],
      },
      {
        title: 'Safe Browsing Practices',
        content: 'Web browsers are a primary gateway for cyber threats. Use modern, updated browsers with built-in security features. Be cautious about extensions—only install those from trusted sources and remove ones you do not use. Enable pop-up blockers and phishing protection. Use HTTPS Everywhere or similar extensions to ensure encrypted connections. Clear your browsing data regularly and consider using private/incognito mode for sensitive activities.',
        examples: [
          'Using Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge with auto-updates enabled',
          'Installing only essential browser extensions from official stores',

    introduction: 'Web browsing is one of the most common online activities, and it presents numerous security and privacy risks. From malicious websites that install malware to trackers that monitor your behavior, the internet can be dangerous without proper precautions. Learning safe browsing practices protects your devices, data, and privacy.',

        title: 'Understanding HTTPS and Secure Connections',
        content: 'HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) encrypts the communication between your browser and websites, protecting data from eavesdropping. Always look for HTTPS in the URL and a padlock icon in the address bar, especially when entering sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers. HTTP without the "S" transmits data in plain text that anyone on the same network can intercept. Modern browsers warn you when visiting non-HTTPS sites, and you should heed these warnings.',
        examples: [
          'Secure: https://www.bank.com (encrypted connection)',
          'Insecure: http://www.randomsite.com (unencrypted)',
          'Warning sign: Browser shows "Not Secure" next to the URL',
          'Best practice: Never enter passwords or payment info on HTTP sites',

        title: 'Identifying Malicious Websites',
        content: 'Malicious websites can infect your device with malware, steal information through fake login pages, or trick you into scams. Warning signs include suspicious URLs with misspellings or extra characters, excessive pop-ups, poor design and spelling errors, requests to download unexpected files, and browser warnings about unsafe sites. Be especially cautious with sites reached through email links or search results offering deals that seem too good to be true.',
        examples: [
          'Suspicious URL: "amazn.com" instead of "amazon.com"',
          'Red flag: Website immediately prompts multiple pop-ups',

Always use HTTPS connections, verify website legitimacy, configure browser security settings, manage cookies and tracking, and exercise caution with downloads. These practices significantly reduce your exposure to online threats while preserving your privacy. Remember: if something feels suspicious or too good to be true, it probably is. Trust your instincts and err on the side of caution.',

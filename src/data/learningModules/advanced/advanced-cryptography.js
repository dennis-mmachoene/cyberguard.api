  content: {
    introduction: 'Advanced cryptography extends beyond basic encryption to encompass digital signatures, key management, quantum-resistant algorithms, and specialized cryptographic protocols. Understanding these concepts enables secure system design and proper cryptographic implementation.',
    sections: [
      {
        title: 'Digital Signatures and Certificates',
        content: 'Digital signatures provide authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation. The signer creates a signature using their private key; anyone can verify using the public key. Digital certificates bind identities to public keys through trusted Certificate Authorities. Certificate chains establish trust from root CAs through intermediates to end entities. Certificate revocation handles compromised certificates through CRLs or OCSP.',
        keyPoints: ['Signatures prove authenticity and integrity', 'Certificates bind identities to keys', 'Trust chains enable PKI'],

        title: 'Key Management Lifecycle',
        content: 'Proper key management is critical for cryptographic security. The lifecycle includes generation (using strong random sources), distribution (secure channels), storage (hardware security modules or key management services), rotation (regular key changes), and destruction (secure deletion). Poor key management undermines even strong algorithms. Hardware security modules (HSMs) provide secure key storage and operations.',
        keyPoints: ['Key management is critical to security', 'Lifecycle covers generation to destruction', 'HSMs provide hardware protection'],

        title: 'Elliptic Curve Cryptography',
        content: 'ECC provides equivalent security to RSA with much smaller key sizes. A 256-bit ECC key offers similar security to a 3072-bit RSA key, enabling faster operations and lower resource consumption. ECC is increasingly used in mobile devices, IoT, and modern protocols. Common curves include P-256, P-384, and Curve25519.',

        title: 'Post-Quantum Cryptography',
        content: 'Quantum computers threaten current public-key cryptography. RSA and ECC could be broken by sufficiently powerful quantum computers using Shor\'s algorithm. Post-quantum cryptography develops algorithms resistant to quantum attacks. NIST is standardizing quantum-resistant algorithms. Organizations should prepare for cryptographic agility to transition when needed.',

    summary: 'Advanced cryptography encompasses digital signatures for authentication and non-repudiation, proper key management throughout the cryptographic lifecycle, efficient elliptic curve cryptography for modern systems, and preparation for post-quantum threats. Understanding these concepts enables secure system design and anticipation of future cryptographic needs.',

      question: 'What three properties do digital signatures provide?',
      options: ['Encryption, speed, and simplicity', 'Authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation', 'Confidentiality, availability, and safety', 'Privacy, performance, and portability'],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'Digital signatures provide authentication (verifies who signed), integrity (detects tampering), and non-repudiation (signer cannot deny signing). They do not provide confidentiality—signed messages can be read by anyone.',

      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'ECC\'s main advantage is providing equivalent security to RSA with much smaller key sizes. For example, a 256-bit ECC key offers similar security to a 3072-bit RSA key, resulting in faster operations and lower resource requirements.',

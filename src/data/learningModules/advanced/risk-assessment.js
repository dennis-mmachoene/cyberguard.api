    introduction: 'Risk assessment systematically evaluates potential cybersecurity threats to an organization, determining their likelihood and impact. Effective risk assessment informs resource allocation, prioritizes security investments, and supports informed decision-making about accepting, mitigating, or transferring risks.',

        title: 'Risk Assessment Frameworks',
        content: 'Several frameworks guide risk assessment. NIST SP 800-30 provides federal government guidance applicable to any organization. ISO 27005 offers international standards for information security risk management. FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk) enables quantitative risk analysis. OCTAVE focuses on organizational risk. Each framework has strengths for different contexts. Choose based on organizational needs, resources, and regulatory requirements. Consistency in methodology enables comparison across assessments.',
        examples: [

        title: 'Asset Identification and Valuation',
        content: 'Risk assessment begins with understanding what to protect. Assets include data, systems, people, and physical infrastructure. Classify assets by criticality to business operations. Determine asset value considering replacement cost, business impact if unavailable, regulatory penalties for breach, and reputational damage. High-value assets warrant stronger protection. Create asset inventory with ownership, dependencies, and criticality ratings. Update regularly as systems change.',
        examples: [
          'Critical: Customer payment card database',
          'Important: Corporate email system',
          'Moderate: Internal wiki documentation',

      {
        title: 'Vulnerability and Threat Identification',
        content: 'Identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited: software flaws, misconfigurations, weak policies, lack of training. Use vulnerability scanners, penetration tests, code reviews, and security assessments. Identify relevant threats: natural disasters, human errors, malicious actors, system failures. Not all theoretical vulnerabilities face realistic threats. Pair vulnerabilities with threats to understand actual risks. A vulnerability without corresponding threat may be low priority.',
        examples: [
          'Vulnerability: Unpatched web server with known RCE flaw',
          'Threat: Script kiddies scanning for exploitable systems',

        title: 'Qualitative vs Quantitative Assessment',
        content: 'Qualitative assessment uses descriptive scales (high, medium, low) for likelihood and impact. It is faster, requires less data, and is intuitive for communication. Quantitative assessment assigns numeric values to calculate risk in monetary terms (annual loss expectancy). It is more precise but requires extensive data and assumptions. Many organizations use hybrid approaches: qualitative for initial assessment, quantitative for high-priority risks requiring investment justification.',
        examples: [
          'Qualitative: Ransomware risk rated "High likelihood, High impact"',
          'Quantitative: ALE = $500K (SLE $2.5M × ARO 20%)',
          'Hybrid: Qualify all risks, quantify top 10 for budget decisions',

          'Qualitative uses descriptive categories',
          'Quantitative calculates monetary risk',

      {
        title: 'Risk Treatment and Monitoring',
        content: 'After identifying and evaluating risks, determine treatment strategies. Risk acceptance formally acknowledges risks within tolerance. Risk mitigation implements controls reducing likelihood or impact. Risk transfer shares risk through insurance or outsourcing. Risk avoidance eliminates activities creating risk. Document all decisions with justification. Risk assessment is not one-time—threats, vulnerabilities, and business context change. Establish continuous monitoring, periodic reassessment, and metrics tracking risk posture over time.',
        examples: [
          'Accept: Low-impact risks below tolerance threshold',
          'Mitigate: Deploy MFA to reduce credential compromise risk',

      },
    ],
    summary: 'Comprehensive risk assessment evaluates cybersecurity threats systematically using established frameworks. Asset valuation identifies what to protect and how much to invest in protection. Vulnerability and threat identification determine what can go wrong. Qualitative and quantitative methods assess risk magnitude. Risk treatment strategies balance security with business needs. Continuous monitoring ensures risk management remains effective as threats and systems evolve.',

      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'A vulnerability without a corresponding realistic threat may be low priority because risk requires both to materialize. For example, a vulnerability requiring physical access to a secure facility faces low threat likelihood. Focusing on vulnerabilities with active threats optimizes security resources.',

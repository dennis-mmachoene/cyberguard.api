    introduction: 'Secure communication ensures that messages remain confidential, authentic, and intact during transmission. As digital communication becomes ubiquitous, protecting conversations from eavesdropping, tampering, and impersonation is essential for both personal privacy and business security.',

        title: 'Email Security Fundamentals',
        content: 'Email was not designed with security in mind—messages travel unencrypted by default and can be intercepted or spoofed. Transport Layer Security (TLS) encrypts email in transit between mail servers, but does not protect stored messages. S/MIME and PGP provide end-to-end encryption where only sender and recipient can read messages. Digital signatures verify sender identity and message integrity. SPF, DKIM, and DMARC protocols help prevent email spoofing. However, email metadata (sender, recipient, subject, timestamp) remains visible even when content is encrypted.',
        examples: [
          'TLS: Email encrypted between Gmail and Outlook servers',
          'S/MIME: Encrypted and signed corporate email',
          'PGP: Encrypted messages with public key cryptography',
          'DMARC: Reject emails failing authentication checks',
        ],
        keyPoints: [
          'Email travels unencrypted by default',
          'TLS protects in transit, not at rest',
          'End-to-end encryption requires S/MIME or PGP',
          'SPF/DKIM/DMARC prevent spoofing',

        title: 'Instant Messaging Security',
        content: 'Modern messaging apps offer varying levels of security. End-to-end encryption ensures only communicating parties can read messages—even the service provider cannot decrypt them. Signal Protocol, used by Signal, WhatsApp, and others, provides strong end-to-end encryption. Metadata protection hides who communicates with whom. Forward secrecy ensures past messages remain secure even if keys are compromised. Secure deletion removes messages from all devices. Some platforms prioritize features over security, transmitting messages in plaintext or with weak encryption.',
        examples: [
          'Signal: Strong encryption with metadata protection',
          'WhatsApp: End-to-end encrypted but collects metadata',
          'iMessage: Encrypted but tied to Apple ecosystem',
          'SMS: No encryption, messages easily intercepted',

      },
      {
        title: 'Voice and Video Call Security',
        content: 'Voice over IP (VoIP) and video calls can be intercepted without encryption. Secure calling apps use encryption protocols like SRTP (Secure Real-time Transport Protocol) to protect audio and video streams. End-to-end encrypted calls ensure privacy even from service providers. Authentication prevents man-in-the-middle attacks through verification codes or fingerprints. Traditional phone networks (cellular and landline) offer minimal security and can be intercepted with appropriate equipment. Zoom-bombing and similar attacks exploit poor access controls rather than encryption weaknesses.',
        examples: [
          'Secure: Signal video calls with end-to-end encryption',
          'Secure: FaceTime with encryption between Apple devices',
          'Risk: Unencrypted VoIP calls over public WiFi',
          'Risk: Conference calls with weak passwords or no authentication',

      {
        title: 'Secure File Sharing',
        content: 'Sharing files securely requires encryption in transit and at rest, access controls, and audit logging. Cloud storage services like Dropbox and Google Drive encrypt files but can access them. Zero-knowledge providers like Tresorit encrypt files client-side, preventing provider access. Password-protected archives (zip, 7z) provide basic protection but rely on password strength. Secure file transfer protocols like SFTP and HTTPS encrypt during transmission. Time-limited links and access controls restrict who can download files and for how long.',
        examples: [
          'Zero-knowledge: Tresorit encrypts before upload, provider cannot decrypt',
          'Standard cloud: Dropbox encrypts storage but has access to decryption keys',
          'Secure transfer: SFTP for encrypted file uploads/downloads',
          'Temporary sharing: WeTransfer links that expire after downloads',

        title: 'Best Practices for Secure Communication',
        content: 'Verify correspondent identity through multiple channels before sharing sensitive information. Use strong, unique passwords for communication accounts and enable two-factor authentication. Avoid communicating sensitive information over unencrypted channels like SMS or unencrypted email. Be aware of metadata that remains visible even with encryption. Regularly update communication apps to patch security vulnerabilities. Use secure devices and networks—avoid public WiFi for sensitive communications without VPN protection. Educate communication partners on security practices.',
        examples: [
          'Verification: Confirm identity via phone call before sending confidential documents',
          'Protection: Enable 2FA on all email and messaging accounts',
          'Awareness: Remember that email subject lines are never encrypted',

        ],
      },
    ],
    summary: 'Secure communication requires encryption, authentication, and awareness of how different platforms handle data. Email needs additional security layers beyond default settings. Messaging apps vary significantly in security. Voice and video calls require encryption to prevent interception. File sharing needs encryption and access controls. Following best practices and choosing secure platforms protects communication privacy and integrity.',

      question: 'What does end-to-end encryption in messaging mean?',
      options: [
        'Messages are encrypted only during transmission',
        'Only the communicating parties can read messages, not even the service provider',
        'Messages are encrypted on the sender\'s device only',
        'Messages are stored encrypted on servers',
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'End-to-end encryption means only the communicating parties can read messages. Messages are encrypted on the sender\'s device and only decrypted on the recipient\'s device. Even the service provider cannot decrypt and read the messages. This provides the strongest privacy protection.',

      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: 'SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) work together to prevent email spoofing.

      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'A zero-knowledge cloud storage provider encrypts files on your device before uploading them, and only you hold the decryption keys.

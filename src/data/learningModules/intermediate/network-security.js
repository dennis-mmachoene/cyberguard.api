    introduction: 'Network security involves protecting the infrastructure and data that travel across networks from threats and unauthorized access. As organizations increasingly rely on networked systems, understanding network security principles becomes critical for protecting sensitive information and maintaining business continuity.',

        title: 'Network Security Architecture',
        content: 'Network security architecture involves designing layered defenses using multiple security controls. The perimeter layer uses firewalls and intrusion detection systems to filter incoming and outgoing traffic. The internal network layer segments traffic using VLANs and access control lists. The endpoint layer protects individual devices with antivirus and host-based firewalls. The data layer uses encryption to protect information in transit and at rest. Defense in depth ensures that if one layer fails, others provide continued protection.',

        title: 'Firewalls and Access Control',
        content: 'Firewalls control network traffic based on predefined security rules. Packet-filtering firewalls inspect packets and allow or deny based on source/destination addresses and ports. Stateful firewalls track connections and understand context. Next-generation firewalls add deep packet inspection, application awareness, and intrusion prevention. Access control lists define which traffic is permitted between network segments. Properly configured firewalls block unauthorized access while allowing legitimate business traffic.',
        examples: [
          'Rule: Block all incoming traffic except web (80/443) and email (25/587)',

        content: 'Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and generate alerts. Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) actively block detected threats. Signature-based detection identifies known attack patterns. Anomaly-based detection establishes baselines and flags deviations. Network IDS/IPS analyze traffic at strategic points, while host-based versions protect individual systems. IDS/IPS must be tuned to reduce false positives while maintaining security effectiveness.',

        content: 'VPNs create secure, encrypted connections over untrusted networks like the internet. Site-to-site VPNs connect entire networks securely. Remote access VPNs allow individual users to connect securely from any location. VPNs use tunneling protocols like IPsec or OpenVPN to encapsulate and encrypt traffic. Split tunneling allows some traffic through the VPN while routing other traffic directly to the internet. VPNs are essential for secure remote work and connecting distributed offices.',

  questions: [
    {
      question: 'What is the primary purpose of network segmentation?',
      options: [
        'To increase network speed',
        'To reduce hardware costs',
        'To limit lateral movement and contain security breaches',
        'To simplify network management',
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: 'Network segmentation limits lateral movement by dividing the network into separate zones with controlled access between them. If attackers compromise one segment, segmentation prevents them from easily moving to other parts of the network, containing the breach and limiting damage.',

    {
      question: 'What is the difference between an IDS and an IPS?',
      options: [
        'IDS is hardware-based while IPS is software-based',
        'IDS detects and alerts while IPS actively blocks threats',
        'IDS works on networks while IPS works on hosts',
        'There is no difference, they are the same thing',
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'The key difference is that an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) monitors traffic and generates alerts about suspicious activity, while an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) actively blocks detected threats in addition to alerting. IPS operates inline and can stop attacks in real-time.',

      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: 'A stateful firewall understands the state of network connections and tracks connection context. Unlike packet-filtering firewalls that examine each packet independently, stateful firewalls know whether a packet is part of an established connection, new connection, or invalid, enabling more intelligent filtering decisions.',

      question: 'What is the main security benefit of using a VPN?',
      options: [
        'It makes websites load faster',
        'It encrypts traffic over untrusted networks',
        'It prevents all types of malware',
        'It backs up your data automatically',
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'The main security benefit of a VPN is that it encrypts traffic over untrusted networks like the internet or public WiFi. This prevents eavesdropping and protects sensitive data from interception. VPNs create secure tunnels that protect the confidentiality and integrity of communications.',

      explanation: 'A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system aggregates logs and security events from multiple sources (firewalls, IDS, servers, etc.) and correlates them to identify patterns and potential security incidents. This centralized visibility and correlation capability helps security teams detect threats that might not be visible from any single source.',

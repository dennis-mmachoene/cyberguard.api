    introduction: 'Encryption is the process of converting readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) to protect its confidentiality. Only those with the correct decryption key can convert ciphertext back to plaintext. Encryption is fundamental to modern cybersecurity, protecting everything from online banking to messaging apps.',

        title: 'Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption',
        content: 'Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. It is fast and efficient for large amounts of data but requires secure key distribution. Examples include AES and DES. Asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Anyone can encrypt with the public key, but only the private key holder can decrypt. It solves the key distribution problem but is computationally slower. RSA and ECC are common asymmetric algorithms.',
        examples: [
          'Symmetric: AES-256 encrypting a hard drive (same key encrypts and decrypts)',
          'Asymmetric: RSA encrypting an email (recipient\'s public key encrypts, their private key decrypts)',
          'Hybrid: HTTPS uses both (asymmetric for key exchange, symmetric for data)',
          'Key exchange: Diffie-Hellman allows secure key agreement over insecure channels',
        ],
        keyPoints: [
          'Symmetric encryption uses one key for both operations',
          'Asymmetric encryption uses public/private key pairs',

        title: 'Hash Functions',
        content: 'Hash functions take any input and produce a fixed-size output (hash or digest). Good cryptographic hashes are one-way (cannot be reversed), deterministic (same input always produces same output), and collision-resistant (extremely difficult to find two inputs with the same hash). Hashes verify data integrity and store passwords securely. Common algorithms include SHA-256 and SHA-3. Hashing is not encryption—it cannot be decrypted.',
        examples: [
          'Password storage: Hash passwords with bcrypt or Argon2, never store plaintext',
          'File integrity: Download SHA-256 hash to verify file was not tampered with',
          'Digital signatures: Hash message, sign hash with private key',

        title: 'Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)',
        content: 'PKI is the framework for managing digital certificates and public keys. Certificate Authorities (CAs) issue digital certificates that bind public keys to entities (people, organizations, websites). Certificates contain the public key, entity information, and the CA\'s digital signature. Web browsers trust CAs to verify website identities, enabling HTTPS. The chain of trust starts with root CAs, extends through intermediate CAs, to end-entity certificates. PKI enables secure communications at scale.',

          'HTTPS: Browser verifies website certificate before establishing secure connection',

        title: 'Encryption in Transit vs At Rest',
        content: 'Data in transit moves across networks and needs protection from interception. TLS/SSL encrypts data between clients and servers. VPNs encrypt all traffic between endpoints. Data at rest is stored on devices and needs protection from physical theft or unauthorized access. Full disk encryption protects entire drives. File-level encryption protects specific files or folders. Database encryption protects sensitive records. Both forms of encryption are essential for comprehensive data protection.',

          'In transit: HTTPS encrypts web traffic, protecting credentials and personal data',
          'In transit: Email TLS encrypts messages between mail servers',

        title: 'Common Encryption Pitfalls',
        content: 'Many encryption failures result from improper implementation rather than weak algorithms. Using weak or outdated algorithms (DES, MD5) provides false security. Hardcoding keys in source code exposes them. Weak key generation reduces encryption strength. Lack of authentication allows tampering even if confidentiality is preserved. Improper certificate validation enables man-in-the-middle attacks. Relying on security through obscurity fails when systems are exposed. Use well-tested libraries and follow security best practices.',

          'Pitfall: Using WEP for WiFi (broken, use WPA3 instead)',
          'Pitfall: Storing encryption keys in code repositories',
          'Pitfall: Not validating HTTPS certificates (accepting all certificates)',
          'Pitfall: Using ECB mode for AES (patterns leak, use CBC or GCM)',

        keyPoints: [
          'Implementation mistakes undermine strong algorithms',
          'Never hardcode keys or use weak algorithms',

    summary: 'Encryption protects data confidentiality through mathematical algorithms. Symmetric encryption is fast but requires key sharing. Asymmetric encryption enables secure communication without prior key exchange. Hash functions ensure integrity. PKI provides trust frameworks for secure communications at scale. Proper encryption of data in transit and at rest is essential for comprehensive security.',

    {
      question: 'What is the main advantage of asymmetric encryption over symmetric encryption?',
      options: [
        'It is faster for encrypting large amounts of data',
        'It uses smaller keys',
        'It solves the key distribution problem',
        'It produces stronger encryption',
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: 'The main advantage of asymmetric encryption is solving the key distribution problem. With public key cryptography, you can share your public key openly, and anyone can use it to send you encrypted messages that only your private key can decrypt. This eliminates the challenge of securely distributing symmetric keys.',

    {
      question: 'Can a hash function be reversed to recover the original input?',
      options: [
        'Yes, using the same algorithm',
        'Yes, with the decryption key',
        'No, cryptographic hash functions are one-way',
        'Only if the hash is stored in plaintext',
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: 'Cryptographic hash functions are designed to be one-way functions that cannot be reversed. While you can hash data to produce a digest, you cannot take a hash and reverse it to recover the original input. This property makes hashes ideal for password storage and integrity verification.',

      question: 'What is the role of a Certificate Authority (CA) in PKI?',

      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'Certificate Authorities issue and verify digital certificates that bind public keys to entities. When a CA signs a certificate, they vouch that the certificate holder is who they claim to be.

      question: 'Why should encryption keys never be hardcoded in source code?',

        'Hardcoded keys do not work with modern encryption',
        'It violates software licensing agreements',
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'Hardcoding encryption keys in source code is dangerous because if the source code is compromised (through repository leaks, decompilation, or insider threats), the keys are immediately exposed. Keys should be stored securely outside the codebase, such as in secure key management systems or environment variables.',
